The 4th-generation integrated neural network internet (termed "AI-Net") is revolutionizing human-computer interaction (HCI) from "GUI operations" to "intent-driven seamless collaboration," powered by AI agents that enable autonomous services, natural interactions, and context-aware experiences. This analysis covers technical architecture, interaction paradigms, case studies, and future trends:

---

### 1. **Core Features: AI-Agent Driven Interaction Evolution**
1. **From Interfaces to Intent**  
   - **GUI Obsolescence**: Former Google CEO Schmidt notes WIMP (Windows/Icons/Menus/Pointer) interactions as "50-year-old paradigms." Future users simply voice intents (e.g., "Book tomorrow's 2pm高铁 to Shanghai") for AI to execute task chains.  
   - **On-Device AI**: Qualcomm's "AI-as-UI" vision delivers <10ms latency, privacy (local processing), and personalization through continuous learning.

2. **Multimodal Fusion**  
   - **Hyper-Realistic Agents**: iFlytek's Spark 4.0 Turbo integrates voice/video/text for contextual interactions (e.g., generating stories from toy movements).  
   - **Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint/Face ID/eye-tracking replace passwords, cutting authentication steps by 70% in healthcare/finance.

### 2. **New HCI Paradigms: RICH Model & Spatial Design**
1. **RICH Framework**  
   | **Dimension**  | **Principle**                                                     | **Case Study**                          |
   |---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
   | **Role**      | AI persona (e.g., butler/assistant) defines tone & emotional IQ   | Huawei Celia proactively manages schedules |
   | **Intention** | Deep intent parsing ("I'm hungry" → food delivery/recipes)        | GUI Agent clarifies ambiguous requests  |
   | **Conversation** | Natural dialog flows replace GUI steps                          | Ant Group designs interactions as "screenplay writing" |
   | **Hybrid**    | Voice/gesture/GUI modality switching                             | HarmonyOS "Tap-to-Connect" + air gestures |

2. **Spatial Experiences**  
   - **Bento Grids**: Modular layouts (e.g., finance apps with asset/trading/news zones) enable 3-sec information access.  
   - **3D Interaction**: Product teardowns/virtual try-ons create explorable spaces (e.g., shoe apps with 360° views + material haptics).  
   - **XR Collaboration**: 5G-A enables split rendering (8K VR streaming to headsets at ms latency) for industrial/entertainment uses.

### 3. **Tech Stack: Agent Coordination & Edge-Cloud Fusion**
1. **GUI Agents**  
   - China Mobile's JT-GUIAgent-V2 (AndroidWorld #1, 67.2% success rate) features:  
     - **Two-stage architecture**: Planner decomposes tasks → Grounder manipulates UI elements.  
     - **Experience-driven ops**: 40% fewer icon misidentifications via historical data matching.  
   - Use cases: Cross-app workflows (12306→maps), office automation (docs→emails).

2. **Hybrid AI Architecture**  
   - **Edge**: Lightweight models (e.g., China Unicom's 1B/2B Yuanjing) handle real-time tasks.  
   - **5G-A 10Gbps pipes**: Enable XR split rendering/digital twins at <1ms latency.

---

### 4. **Industry Adoption**
1. **Consumer Tech**  
   - **HarmonyOS Agent Framework**: "Grab-drop" photo transfers across devices create seamless "travel-meeting" workflows.  
   - **Wearables**: Snapdragon AR1 glasses (eye-tracking/gestures) aid surgeons accessing records hands-free.

2. **Industrial**  
   - **GUI Agents**: Control robots/monitor production lines (35% higher fault prediction).  
   - **City Digital Twins**: 100k AI nodes process traffic/emergency/energy data for second-level disaster response.

---

### 5. **Challenges & Future**
1. **Technical Hurdles**  
   - **Intent ambiguity**: Requires multi-turn clarification; RICH demands UX designers with psychology/scriptwriting skills.  
   - **Power efficiency**: On-device AI consumes 30% device power; photonic chips (0.1pJ/op) may help.

2. **Ethics/Compliance**  
   - **Data sovereignty**: Cross-border systems must comply with regulations (e.g., EU medical data localization).  
   - **Liability**: Need clear human oversight rules for GUI Agent errors (e.g., financial trades).

3. **Future Trends**  
   - **Brain-Computer Interfaces**: Neuralink implants + cloud knowledge (ALS speech error <3%).  
   - **National Testbeds**: China's "Brain Science" project builds 100k-node city-scale platforms for trillion-parameter models.

### **Conclusion: The Invisible Interface**
4th-gen HCI embodies **"disappearing interfaces, intent-first"** design. When devices become autonomous agents (HarmonyOS's proactive care, GUI Agents' automation) and interactions evolve into multimodal XR spaces (eye+gesture+voice), users shift from operators to decision-makers. As Schmidt noted: "Great design is invisible." In this AI-Net era, **users wish, agents act**, unlocking civilization's "cognitive surplus" potential.
